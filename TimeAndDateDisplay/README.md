I myself was always looking for a good working script for a Time And Date Display with real life times, so that the real life time is in your screen.

But I could never really find anything good, and something that actually did it well so that's why I made this **Time And Date Display** Script.

# TimeAndDateDisplay-FiveM

A script that allows you to always show the real life time and real life date on the top right of your screen.

### Features:

> - Real Life Time and Date is in the upper right corner of your screen.
> - A option to show your server name in after the time.
> - A option to show the players his own name under the time.
> - A option to show to players his ingame id under the time.
> - Easy Configure everyting.
> - The Script does not cause lag or reduce server performance because it goes through the HTML and JS.

### Requirements:

> - None
